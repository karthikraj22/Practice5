            External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.For example, a heading element will be in a separate line from a paragraph element. Every HTML page uses these three tags: <html> tag is the root element that defines the whole HTML document. <head> tag holds meta information such as the page's title and charset.HTML and CSS are used to design attractive web pages.
